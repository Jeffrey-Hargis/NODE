# Speed Test

> An embeddable speed test powered by SamKnows.

## Installation

```
$ npm install --save speedtest
```

## Usage

```js
var initSpeedTest = require('speedtest');

var speedTest = initSpeedTest({
  el: '#speedtest',
  width: 800,
  height: 370
});
```

The speed test will adjust to fit in the space given to it - even small ones.
If a width and height are not specified in the options, it will attempt to use
the width and height of the specified element.

There are a few other options, too:

- `primary`: The colour of the needle.
- `secondary`: The colour of the button and gauge.
- `lang`: Hard code a different language. Generally not needed - defaults to
browser language.


The speed test emits an event when a speed test is complete, containing data
about the test:

```js
speedTest.on('complete', function (results) {
  console.log(results);
});
```
